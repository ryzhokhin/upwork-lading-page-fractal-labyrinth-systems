# Reflector Landing Page

This repository contains the frontend implementation of the **Reflector** landing page — a modern, logic-based human intelligence software. The landing page is being built based on a provided mockup and aligns with a clean, elegant, and minimal design aesthetic.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3** (with potential use of TailwindCSS for layout)
- **JavaScript** (vanilla, used for hover-based interactions and animations)

## Features

- Responsive layout (mobile + desktop)
- Pixel-perfect implementation of the provided wireframe
- Smooth scrolling and hover-to-reveal content blocks
- Clean font hierarchy and whitespace balance
- Static, single-page layout — no navigation tabs or dynamic routing

## Development Notes

- No templates, themes, or page builders used — 100% built from scratch
- Optionally compatible with WordPress if needed (custom code only)
- Project is expected to be completed in 5–10 days
- All assets and design cues are based on the provided mockup
